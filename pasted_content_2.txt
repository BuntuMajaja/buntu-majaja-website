Context Brief: Buntu Majaja — Personal Hub (MVP → Platform)
1) Purpose & Vision

Build a personal media-universe hub that starts lean but is architected to evolve into a productized platform. MVP focuses on three channels:

About (human story, values, credibility)

Portfolio (case studies with role, actions, outcomes)

Newsletter (FutureSight Africa signup + links)

Secondary links (footer only): Book/Gumroad, socials.

North Star: ship fast, look premium, and keep the codebase modular so I can extend it into micro-SaaS features later (speaking, store, member areas, dashboards).

2) Product Principles

Own the repo. Clear, readable code I can extend in Cursor/VS Code.

Modular by default. Pages compose reusable sections; content types are isolated.

Static first. SSG/ISR where possible for speed and low cost; SSR only when necessary.

Accessible + performant. WCAG AA, Lighthouse ≥90 desktop.

Zero vendor lock-in. Easy to add/remove CMS or payments later.

3) Tech Stack (opinionated)

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router, TS)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

UI: shadcn/ui (Radix) + lucide-react

Content: MDX via Contentlayer (no external CMS in MVP)

Animations: Framer Motion (light touch)

SEO/Analytics: next-metadata + /api/og, sitemap/robots, Plausible

Deploy: GitHub → Vercel (CI/CD)

Rationale: trains real app skills, keeps hosting cost near-zero, and is easy to extend with a headless CMS (Sanity/Contentful) later.

4) Information Architecture (MVP)

Routes:

/ Home (universe landing → tiles to channels; preview 2 portfolio items)

/about (long-form MDX)

/portfolio (grid with tag filters)

/portfolio/[slug] (MDX detail)

/newsletter (pitch + embed placeholder)

/cv → redirects to /cv.pdf in /public

Footer: © {year} Buntu Majaja Inc. | Socials | “Read my Book” (Gumroad)

5) Content Model (Contentlayer)

/content/projects/*.mdx

title: string
slug: string
summary: string   # <=160 chars
role: string
outcome: string
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: string[]    # ["Innovation","Investment","Property","Tech"]
thumbnail: string # /public/portfolio/...


MDX body supports headings, lists, images, callouts.

/content/posts/*.mdx (seed; not linked yet)

6) Code Structure
/app
  /(site)/layout.tsx
  /(site)/page.tsx          # Home
  /about/page.tsx
  /portfolio/page.tsx
  /portfolio/[slug]/page.tsx
  /newsletter/page.tsx
  /api/og/route.ts
/components
  /ui/*                      # shadcn components
  navbar.tsx
  footer.tsx
  channel-card.tsx
  section.tsx
  filters.tsx
/content
  /projects/*.mdx
  /posts/*.mdx
/lib
  contentlayer.ts
  seo.ts
  utils.ts
/public
  cv.pdf
  /portfolio/*


Rules:

Keep components pure/presentational where possible.

One responsibility per file. Co-locate small helpers in /lib.

No magic; add comments for anything non-obvious.

Animation optional and additive (respect prefers-reduced-motion).

7) Styling & Design System

Dark first: near-black bg, off-white text, single electric accent.

Type: Display (e.g., Clash/Satoshi), Body (Inter/Geist).

Spacing: consistent scale via Tailwind; 12-col grid.

UI tokens: use Tailwind config and shadcn tokens; no ad-hoc colors.

Focus states: visible, accessible; keyboard nav must work everywhere.

8) Interactions (light)

Card hover: scale ~1.02 + subtle shadow/glow.

Section reveal: fade + translateY(8px), stagger 70–120ms.

Reduce motion for users who request it.

9) SEO & Perf

Proper <Metadata> per route; canonical, open graph, twitter cards.

/api/og generates OG images from project frontmatter.

next/image everywhere; preload main heading font.

sitemap.xml, robots.txt.

Plausible via env var toggle.

10) Tooling & DevEx

TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier configured.

pnpm preferred; scripts in README (dev, build, lint).

Contentlayer build documented.

Minimal env var handling (PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN, etc.).

GitHub Actions optional (Vercel handles CI).

11) Deployment Workflow

Local dev in Cursor/VS Code.

GitHub repo (main + feature branches).

Vercel connected; preview deployments for PRs; main → production.

Custom domain on Vercel; HTTPS auto.

12) Future Extensions (design for now, build later)

Speaking page with 3 signature talks + booking form.

Store page with LemonSqueezy/Gumroad embeds.

Headless CMS (Sanity): mirror Contentlayer schema; swap data source.

Command-K site search (Pagefind/Algolia lite).

Auth & members (Clerk/NextAuth) only if/when needed.

13) Non-Goals (MVP)

No backend DB, no auth, no Stripe server code.

No CMS dashboard (MDX in repo is fine).

No heavy animation that hurts CLS/LCP.

14) Acceptance Criteria

Lighthouse (desktop): Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 90.

Portfolio grid renders from MDX; tag filters work client-side.

Two sample projects included.

Newsletter page includes clear embed placeholder and CTA buttons.

/cv downloads PDF; OG images render for project detail pages.

Clear README with setup, scripts, envs, and deploy steps.

15) Risks & Mitigations

Bloat/complexity: keep dependencies minimal; document choices.

Vendor lock-in: avoid platform-specific APIs; isolate data layer.

Stale feel: add a small “Now” paragraph on Home that’s easy to update.

16) Single Sentence Summary (for the builder)

Deliver a Next.js 14 + Tailwind + shadcn dark-mode personal hub for Buntu Majaja with About / Portfolio / Newsletter, MDX via Contentlayer, modular components, high accessibility/performance, Vercel-ready CI/CD, and a codebase that’s easy to extend in Cursor/VS Code into micro-SaaS features later.

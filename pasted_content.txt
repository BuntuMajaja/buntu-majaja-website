Goal:
Build a personal “media-universe” hub inspired by the information architecture of profgmedia.com (content channels on homepage), but for Buntu Majaja. This is a lean MVP with three primary channels: About, Portfolio, Newsletter (+ footer link to a book on Gumroad). Prioritize clean code, performance, accessibility, and modern aesthetics.

Tech Stack (opinionated):

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

UI kit: shadcn/ui (Radix primitives)

Animations: Framer Motion

Icons: lucide-react

Content: MDX via Contentlayer (no external CMS yet)

Analytics: Plausible

SEO: sitemap.xml, robots.txt, Open Graph images via /api/og

Deploy target: Vercel

TypeScript everywhere, ESLint + Prettier configured

Routes & Pages:

/ (Home)

Purpose: “Universe” landing that routes into channels.

Sections (in order):

Hero with headline + short subcopy.

Channel tiles (3 cards with motion): About, Portfolio, Newsletter.

Featured teasers:

2 latest Portfolio items (from MDX)

2 latest Newsletter posts (just placeholders/links for now)

Footer: socials, small print, and “Read my book” (Gumroad link).

/about

Long-form MDX page with 3 blocks: Mission, Credibility (highlights), Now/Next.

CTA row: Download CV (link to /public/cv.pdf), Email mailto, LinkedIn.

/portfolio

Grid of MDX case studies with filter chips (tags).

Clicking a card opens /portfolio/[slug] (MDX detail page).

/newsletter

Simple pitch + embed form placeholder for Beehiiv/Substack.

Room for 3 “highlighted posts” (static placeholders).

Components (shadcn/ui + custom):

Navbar (sticky, minimal, links: Home, About, Portfolio, Newsletter)

Footer (social icons + Gumroad button)

ChannelCard (hover motion, subtle glow, arrow)

Section wrapper (max-width, spacing)

Tag chips for portfolio filters

Marquee (optional, simple CSS) for partner/logo strip (placeholder)

NowBadge (small pill for “Now/Active” items)

Contentlayer / MDX Model:

Projects (/content/projects/*.mdx)

title: string

slug: string

summary: string (<=160 chars)

role: string (e.g., “Ecosystem Lead”, “Strategist”)

outcome: string (quant or qualitative results)

date: string (YYYY-MM-DD)

tags: string[] (e.g., ["Innovation","Investment","Property","Tech"])

thumbnail: string (path under /public/portfolio/)

MDX body supports headings, lists, images, callouts.

Posts (/content/posts/*.mdx) — create folder + example file for future use (not linked yet).

Home Page Copy (placeholder):

Hero H1: “Buntu Majaja — Ecosystem Builder • Strategist • Investor”

Subcopy (one line): “I design and scale innovation systems that convert vision into ventures across Africa.”

Channel tiles:

About → “The story, values, and what I’m building next.”

Portfolio → “Case studies: role, actions, outcomes.”

Newsletter → “FutureSight Africa — weekly notes on innovation & capital.”

Design Language (edgy, restrained):

Dark first. Background #0B0B0C (near-black), foreground #EDEDED.

Single accent: electric cyan (#00E5FF) for highlights/focus rings.

Typography: Headings Clash Display or Satoshi (fallback Inter/Geist). Body: Inter or Geist.

Big negative space, 12-column grid, elegant card shadows (very soft), 2xl radii.

Motion: fade+translateY(8px) on section reveal; cards scale to 1.02 on hover; staggered children (70–120ms).

Focus-visible styles, WCAG AA contrast, prefers-reduced-motion respected.

Performance & SEO:

Use next/image for thumbnails.

Preload heading font.

Metadata per route; canonical tags.

/api/og endpoint to generate dynamic OG images from title + tags.

Add sitemap.xml and robots.txt.

Footer:

Left: © {currentYear} Buntu Majaja Inc.

Right: icon links (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, GitHub, YouTube) + Button: “Read my Book” → placeholder Gumroad URL.

Hidden links ready for future: /speaking, /media, /video, /store (don’t expose in nav yet).

Newsletter page:

Header + paragraph, then an embed placeholder <div id="newsletter-embed" /> with a comment indicating where to paste Beehiiv/Substack script later.

Button row: “Read archives” (external), “Support my work” (Buy Me a Coffee placeholder).

CV Shortcut:

Add route alias so /cv redirects to /cv.pdf.

Accessibility & Theming:

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Tailwind focus-visible styles on all interactive elements.

Keyboard navigable filters and cards.

Provide a light theme toggle but default to dark.

Non-goals for MVP:

No auth, no database, no external CMS.

No Stripe integration yet (future store will embed Gumroad/LemonSqueezy).

Deliverables:

Fully running Next.js app with the above pages/components.

Two sample portfolio MDX entries wired to the grid + detail page.

Deployed locally and ready for Vercel (include vercel.json if needed).

README with setup instructions: pnpm i, pnpm dev, Contentlayer build steps, and environment variables (only Plausible site ID placeholder).

Acceptance criteria:

Lighthouse performance > 90 on desktop.

Channel cards on Home animate on hover and navigate correctly.

Portfolio filters work client-side (by tag).

OG image endpoint returns an image for a portfolio detail page.

Sitemap and robots exist; Plausible snippet is behind an env var.

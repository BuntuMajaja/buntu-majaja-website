# Project/Portfolio Card Template (Final Version)

Deeper breakdown when expanded:

1. **Header**

   * Project Title
   * Role / Position
   * Years
   * Meta Tag (Stage badge)

2. **Context**

   * **Advisory:** highlight influence (policy inputs, governance, board outcomes).
   * **Coming Soon:** outline goals, milestones, expected results.

5. **Learning & Reflection**

   * **Completed / Case Study:** retrospective learnings — what worked, what didn’t, lessons carried forward.
   * **Ongoing / Active:** real-time pivots — what’s being adjusted and early insights emerging.
   * **Advisory / Board:** either *so far I’ve learned* (if seasoned) or *anticipating/observing X* (if early).
   * **Coming Soon:** pre-mortem style — key risks or considerations being factored into design.
   * Always keep tone balanced: authentic but constructive.

6. **Leverage / Networks**

   * Partners, ecosystems, collaborators, or systems you worked through.

   * **Ongoing:** invitations to collaborate, invest, support.
   * **Advisory:** note if you’re open to similar roles.
   * **Coming Soon:** clear open call (partners, investors, feedback, etc.).

## Notes

* Every card should showcase **personal involvement** to underline credibility.
* Meta tags are MECE: Past (Completed), Present operational (Ongoing), Present strategic (Advisory), Future (Coming Soon).
* Secondary tags cluster projects by domain and help surface both current credibility and future direction.
* **Leverage / Networks** and **Learning & Reflection** deepen authenticity.
* **Next Steps / Get Involved** adapts by stage.
* Keep tone factual but invitational — transparency without overcommitting liability.
